# Learning C++
I'm approaching this challenge with the goal of learning about C++. I'll be writing a few thoughts on my experience after completing each challenge.


## Day 1
Learning about `std` and printing. First encounter with strings in C++. Messed around with that a bit after completing the challenge. 

## Day 2
I'm finding out that most C code will work in C++. I challenged myself to actively use C++ strings and associated functions to solve the task. 


### Day 3
I ended up writing this in C-style. The problem is easily translated into scanning certain areas in a 2D array. I think the only reason this wouldn't compile on gcc is that I print the result using `cout`.
Next time I need to build a list in whatever form, I'll try to use std::vector::push_back, and work with the vector class instead.
